# AGENTS.md — Fire (Ice fork) working notes

Entry point for coding agents (Codex, and whoever else). Fire is a fork of
jordanbaird/Ice, a macOS 26 menu bar manager, repositioned as AI-native (MCP
server + automations). This file is the fast path; **`HANDOFF.md` has the full
shipped-history and deep context** — read its top CURRENT STATE first. The dated
"🧭 RESUME HERE" block is historical context, not current operating truth.

- **Repo:** `pdurlej/fire-from-ice` (GitHub). Always `-R pdurlej/fire-from-ice`
  for `gh`. Branch: **`fire/main`** (not `main`). Local: `/Users/pd/Developer/fire`.
- **Bundle id stays `com.jordanbaird.Ice`**, product `Ice.app`, on purpose (TCC,
  Sentry, appcast version-matching depend on it).
- **Owner (`pdurlej`) runs the shipped build as his DAILY menu bar manager.** Every
  install step below updates his real machine; every Sentry App-Hang is him
  hitting it in normal use. He can test menu-bar behaviour on request — the only
  way to verify the event-handler paths.

## ✅ LIVE NOW / NEXT

**`v0.11.13-fire.10.7.3` (build 1158, release commit `3865907`) is the live,
notarized build and the newest item on the Sparkle appcast.** It is the release
spine for 10.8. The Ignition tags and `fire/main` history are reference material,
not a base to fix forward.

**10.8 Safe Core is an unshipped candidate on `codex/fire-10.8`.** Its public
contract is issue #18; issues #19–#21 define 10.9–10.11. It must remain a
prerelease until signed desktop E2E. Do not describe local checks as shipped,
and do not promote Latest or update the appcast from this note alone.

Sentry showed no 10.7.2 error events at the 2026-07-13 03:09 CEST checkpoint.
FIRE-Q and FIRE-J are benign modal-menu/dialog App Hangs, but the client-side
`frame.function` filter did **not** suppress them reliably. It is a best-effort
noise filter. A plausible, unproven explanation is that the final function names
become available only after server-side symbolication.

## Commands (exact)

```bash
# Build-gate the app (all targets: Ice + MCPBackend.xpc + MenuBarItemService.xpc)
DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer xcodebuild \
  -project Ice.xcodeproj -scheme Ice -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=macOS' \
  CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="" CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build

# The MCP bridge (separate SPM package)
DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer swift build --package-path Bridge

# Tests (needs the Xcode toolchain — plain `swift test` lacks XCTest)
DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer xcrun swift test --package-path FireLogic
```

**Ship flow** (per release): bump BOTH `MARKETING_VERSION` (`0.11.13-fire.X`) +
`CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` in `Ice.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` (2 occurrences each)
→ commit → `git tag -a v0.11.13-fire.X` → `git push origin fire/main` + push tag
→ CI (`gh run list -R pdurlej/fire-from-ice`) builds/signs/notarizes/uploads-dSYMs
and creates or updates a **prerelease** → download DMG, `ditto` it over
`/Applications/Ice.app` (quit Ice first), run signed smoke, inspect Sentry →
explicitly promote GitHub Latest → **`scripts/publish-appcast.sh
v0.11.13-fire.X`** for Sparkle (one Keychain "Allow"; an existing entry is
accepted only when build, URL, length, and signature match).

## Hard rules

- **Agent-written PRs follow `docs/agent-gates.md`** (gates G1–G10: build,
  tests, lint, issue scope, protected files, evidence in the PR body, owner QA).
  Issues for agents use the "Agent task" template.
- **Do NOT tell the owner to rest / sleep / wrap up** (a documented Opus tic;
  applies to everyone).
- **Owner handles all secrets/tokens/agreements personally.** Never enter API
  tokens. The Sparkle EdDSA key stays in his Keychain — signing is LOCAL, never CI.
- **Oracle** only via the `oracle` MCP wrapper (browser, gpt-5.5-pro); don't rerun
  on timeout (use `oracle-await`).
- Commit trailer for this repo: `Co-Authored-By: <model> <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
- CI GitHub Actions are **SHA-pinned** (tag in a trailing comment). To bump one,
  resolve the SHA via `gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/commits/TAG`.
- **App-Hang model:** Sentry (project `pdurlej/fire`) + dSYM upload in CI means
  each new App Hang symbolicates to a precise stack (FIRE-<letter>). The loop is:
  read the named frame → make a targeted off-main/timeout fix → field-verify by
  the issue going SILENT on the next build. Don't guess; the frame names the organ.

## Gotchas I actually hit (read before repeating)

1. **`log show` is shadowed** by a function in the shell snapshot AND blocked by
   the Bash sandbox. Use the full path `/usr/bin/log show …` and pass
   `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true` (read-only diagnostics only).
2. **Do NOT cache geometry that changes at guard-evaluation time.** fire.10.7
   cached the menu-bar *item* frames for `isMouseInsideMenuBarItem` (#7); it broke
   show-on-hover/click (lagged / misfired / did nothing) because items move at the
   exact instant the guard runs. Reverted in 10.7.1 — that query stays LIVE. The
   *application-menu* frame cache (#17) is fine because it only changes on app
   switch. `⌘-drag` is the one path that bypasses these guards (useful control).
3. **`SecCodeCopySigningInformation` needs `kSecCSSigningInformation`** or the
   returned dict omits the team id. This silently made `ownTeamIdentifier()`
   return nil for every build since fire.10.2 → `.isFromSameTeam()` was NEVER
   applied (fixed in 10.7.1). If you touch signing/XPC-peer code, verify with a
   standalone `SecCode…` probe against `/Applications/Ice.app`.
4. **`publish-appcast.sh`:** `hdiutil attach -quiet` prints nothing and DMG volume
   names contain spaces — parse the mount point via `-plist` + plistlib (already
   done; don't "simplify" it back to grep).
5. **New source files:** the `Ice`, `MCPBackend`, `MenuBarItemService` targets are
   `PBXFileSystemSynchronizedRootGroup`s — adding/removing a `.swift` file needs
   NO pbxproj edit (`git rm`/create just works). The **Bridge** wire files are
   symlinks to `Shared/Services/…`; edit the Shared source, not the symlink.
6. **Notarization needs the owner's Apple Developer Program License Agreement
   in-effect.** If CI fails with HTTP 403 "agreement missing/expired", the owner
   accepts it at developer.apple.com, then `gh run rerun --failed <run-id>` (no
   code change).

## Open issues (`gh issue list -R pdurlej/fire-from-ice`)

| # | P | needs | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| 7 | P2 | design | `isMouseInsideMenuBarItem` live SLS. Do NOT cache (see gotcha #2). If it ever hangs, make the QUERY cheaper. Never fired an App-Hang. |
| 5 | P2 | 10.8 runtime | Deadline is in the local 10.8 candidate without holding the session lock. Still needs kill-STOP signed testing before closure. |
| 11 | P3 | some runtime | remaining LIGHT single main-thread SLS calls (SearchPanel view body, IceBar getOrigin, AppState publisher). |
| 13 | P3 | VoiceOver | a11y labels on fork-added UI. |
| 18 | P1 | 10.8 | Safe Core release contract and promotion gate. |
| 19–21 | roadmap | later | Codex+Claude glance, optional Fireline, then accessibility/polish. |

Shipped from the board so far: #16+#15 (10.4.2), #8+#9 (10.5), #10 (appcast
script), #6+#4+#14 (10.6), and #17's activation-safe app-menu cache plus signed
MCP verification (#4) in 10.7.2. The #7 item-frame cache shipped in 10.7 and was
reverted in 10.7.1. The App-Hang franchise (FIRE-F/G/H/K/M/N/P) is field-quiet;
FIRE-Q/J are false modal ANRs that the current filter catches only best-effort.

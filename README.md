    <p><em>AI-native maintained fork of <a href="https://github.com/jordanbaird/Ice">jordanbaird/Ice</a> - macOS 14–26 support (macOS 27 in progress), signed/notarized DMGs, and an embedded MCP server so AI assistants can read your menu bar</em></p>
</div>

> [!WARNING]
> **macOS 27 Golden Gate:** hiding menu bar items does not work yet. Work in progress, see [#25](https://github.com/pdurlej/fire-from-ice/issues/25) and [`docs/spikes/MACOS27-HIDING-SPIKE.md`](docs/spikes/MACOS27-HIDING-SPIKE.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Upstream Ice received its last code commit on **2025-06-06** and its last stable release (`0.11.12`) predates macOS Sequoia and Tahoe. Multiple Tahoe-only bugs are reported but unaddressed upstream - most visibly the **menu bar items not loading** regression (upstream issues [#744](https://github.com/jordanbaird/Ice/issues/744), [#891](https://github.com/jordanbaird/Ice/issues/891), [#913](https://github.com/jordanbaird/Ice/issues/913); ~80 reactions combined). This fork ships those fixes as proper signed, notarized DMG releases.

> If you're on macOS 26 Tahoe and upstream Ice's Menu Bar Layout pane is empty for you, this fork fixes it.

## Fire vs Thaw vs upstream Ice

Multiple maintained forks of Ice exist - that's healthy for the ecosystem.

- **[stonerl/Thaw](https://github.com/stonerl/Thaw)** is the established maintenance fork of Ice, with no AI features.
- **Fire (this repo)** is an *AI-native* fork. The differentiator is the embedded MCP server (Model Context Protocol) - AI assistants like Claude, Cursor, and Codex can read and (in fire.7+) modify your menu bar layout. **Pick Fire** if you want to experiment with AI-assisted menu bar management.
- **upstream [jordanbaird/Ice](https://github.com/jordanbaird/Ice)** remains the canonical project - both Thaw and Fire honor that. Bugs found in either fork that exist upstream should be filed upstream first.

Fire is maintained by a non-developer running product / vision, with Claude (Anthropic's AI) as the implementation collaborator. That's the experiment - keeping useful software alive when the maintainer cohort isn't there to write the code by hand.

Ice is a powerful menu bar management tool for macOS. While its primary function is hiding and showing menu bar items, it covers many additional features that make it one of the most versatile menu bar tools available.

## What this fork fixes

| Symptom | Upstream issue | Fixed in |
|---|---|---|
| Menu Bar Layout pane shows empty rows on macOS 26 | [#744](https://github.com/jordanbaird/Ice/issues/744), [#891](https://github.com/jordanbaird/Ice/issues/891), [#913](https://github.com/jordanbaird/Ice/issues/913) | `fire.2` + `fire.3` - `MenuBarItemService` XPC peer-requirement guard |
| TCC permissions reset on every new ad-hoc build | n/a (Apple Developer Program required) | `fire.4` - Developer ID signed + Apple-notarized DMG |
| `Node.js 20` deprecation warnings in CI | n/a | `fire.4` workflow - bumped all actions to Node 24 majors |

## Install

### Download the signed DMG

1. Grab the latest `Ice-v0.11.13-fire.X.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/pdurlej/fire-from-ice/releases/latest).
2. Open the DMG. Drag **Ice.app** to your `Applications` folder.
3. Launch from `/Applications`. On first run, macOS may prompt for **Accessibility** and **Screen Recording** - grant both.

The DMG is **signed** with `Developer ID Application: Piotr Durlej (R47JTHX25P)` and **stapled** with an offline notarization ticket. First launch works without an internet round-trip; Gatekeeper accepts on macOS 14 (Sonoma) and later, including Tahoe 26.x.

### Verify the download (optional)

```sh
shasum -a 256 Ice-v0.11.13-fire.X.dmg
# compare with the sha256 shown next to the DMG on its GitHub release page

spctl -a -vv -t install Ice-v0.11.13-fire.X.dmg
# expected: accepted, source=Notarized Developer ID, origin=Developer ID Application: Piotr Durlej (R47JTHX25P)
```

### Upgrading from upstream Ice, or from any Fire ad-hoc build (fire.0/.1/.2/.3)

**One-time** TCC reset is needed after the first install of a signed Fire build over any ad-hoc-signed predecessor - the cryptographic signature anchor changes, so existing TCC grants silently fail to match:

```sh
tccutil reset All com.jordanbaird.Ice
tccutil reset All com.jordanbaird.Ice.MenuBarItemService
osascript -e 'tell application "Ice" to quit'
open /Applications/Ice.app
# then re-grant Accessibility (and Screen Recording if used) in System Settings
```

All subsequent Fire updates (`fire.5+`, signed under the same Team ID) preserve permissions automatically - no further reset needed.

## Auto-updates (Sparkle)

Fire ships with **Sparkle 2.8.0** wired to a custom appcast at <https://pdurlej.github.io/fire-releases/appcast.xml>. After installing Ice, **Check for Updates** (Ice menu → Check for Updates) will auto-discover new Fire releases.

The appcast is signed with **EdDSA** - the public key is embedded in the app's `Info.plist` (`SUPublicEDKey`), and the matching private key lives only in the maintainer's macOS Keychain. A network attacker who tampers with the GitHub Pages feed cannot inject a malicious update.

## Bundle ID & upstream compatibility

This fork keeps the upstream bundle ID `com.jordanbaird.Ice`, so it is a **drop-in replacement** for upstream Ice. Your existing Ice settings (`~/Library/Preferences/com.jordanbaird.Ice.plist`), hotkeys, and menu bar layout persist on upgrade.

## Building from source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pdurlej/fire-from-ice.git
cd fire-from-ice
xcodebuild -scheme Ice -configuration Release \
    CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH=NO
```

The resulting `Ice.app` is unsigned (`ad-hoc`) and will need `tccutil reset` on every rebuild on Tahoe. For signed local builds, the full sign + notarize + staple pipeline is in [`.github/workflows/build-dmg.yml`](.github/workflows/build-dmg.yml).

## MCP Server

Fire ships an embedded MCP server so you can ask an AI assistant to manage your menu bar. Wire Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, or Codex to `/Applications/Ice.app/Contents/MacOS/IceMCPBridge` and 10 tools become available: layout (`list_items`, `hide_item`, `show_item`, `move_item`, `save_layout`, `apply_layout`, `list_layouts`) and automations (`set_trigger`, `list_triggers`, `remove_trigger`). Every write is consent-gated in Fire itself. See [docs/mcp/CLIENT-SETUP.md](docs/mcp/CLIENT-SETUP.md) for setup.

**Automations (fire.10+):** ask your assistant for *"when Slack is frontmost, hide my password manager"*, approve the change once in Fire's consent prompt, and it runs on its own from then on - on app focus, low battery, or a weekly schedule. An automation is a sealed, user-approved capability bound to the exact items and destination you saw in the prompt; manage them in Settings → Automations.

## Privacy & Diagnostics

Fire ships with **opt-in crash reporting** via Sentry. **Default: OFF** - no data leaves your machine until you explicitly enable it in **Advanced Settings → Privacy & Diagnostics**.

When you opt in, Fire sends crash reports only - stack trace, thread state, macOS version, CPU architecture, and Fire version. That is what a maintainer needs to debug a crash and nothing more.

**What is never sent**, even when you opt in:

- Hostname or IP address
- Menu bar item contents (icons, titles, bundle IDs of running apps)
- Screenshots or view hierarchy
- Click/interaction breadcrumbs
- Network requests or fetched URLs
- Any usage analytics or telemetry

The Sentry SDK is only initialized at app launch if the toggle is on. When the toggle is off, no Sentry code runs, no data is collected, and no network connections are opened to Sentry's servers. You can flip it back off at any time; the change takes effect on the next app launch.

This is a Fire-fork-specific addition; upstream Ice has no crash reporting because it predates the maintainer's Apple Developer Program enrollment.
